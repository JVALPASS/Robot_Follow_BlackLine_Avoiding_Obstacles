# Robot_Follow_BlackLine_Avoiding_Obstacles

## Description

The Line Tracking Avoid Obstacles Robot is an Arduino-based project that utilizes an Arduino Uno and a motor shield to create a robot capable of autonomously following a black line on the floor. Equipped with infrared sensors, the robot intelligently detects the black line and adjusts its movements accordingly. It also incorporates obstacle avoidance capabilities to navigate its path successfully.

## Features

- Line Following: The robot employs infrared sensors to detect and track a black line on the floor. By continuously analyzing sensor data, it precisely adjusts its movements to stay on the line.

- Obstacle Avoidance: To ensure seamless navigation, the robot is equipped with obstacle detection sensors. When an obstacle is detected, the robot swiftly alters its course to avoid the obstruction and continues its line-following operation.

- Path Recovery: The robot's intelligence lies in its ability to recover the black line if it deviates from the path. It employs a matrix map developed during navigation, enabling it to identify the shortest path to regain the black line. This feature ensures the robot's resilience in complex environments.

- Bluetooth Communication: With built-in Bluetooth communication, the robot establishes a connection with a smartphone. Users can visualize the matrix map generated by the robot on their smartphones, gaining insights into its navigation and decision-making process.
